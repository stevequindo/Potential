# Potential
my first app :--)

Ideas note:
- a feature to show an example of a plan
- first interation of this app will store plans and data in the Room database, in the future perhaps firebase
- reminder notifications to the user of his purpose of setting that plan in the first place, strucutred into a sentence that is motivational
- the recyclerview item should show the number of days till the deadline 
- objectives and task help reduce the goal to be more manageable, attainable and clear. "Have more clarity with your goal, add objectives and tasks" --> this will have to be some tutorial at the beginning. and information button after the tutorial is done to recap what each component means
- learn how to do databinding 
- create a onboarding feature
